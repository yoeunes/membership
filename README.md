## This is a **community project** and not an official Laravel one

Laravel Zero was created and maintained by [Nuno Maduro](https://github.com/nunomaduro). Laravel Zero is a micro-framework that provides an elegant starting point for your next console application. **Unofficial** and customized version of Laravel optimized for building command-line applications.

- Build on top of the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) components.
- Optional the installation of the [Database/Filesystem components](#components).
- Built with [PHP 7](https://php.net) using modern coding standards.
- Ships with a [Scheduler](#scheduler) and an [Standalone Compiler](#build-a-standalone-application).
- Auto detects commands and supports [Laravel](https://laravel.com) service providers.
- Supports [desktop notifications](https://github.com/laravel-zero/laravel-zero) on Linux, Windows & MacOS.

## Installation & Usage

> **Requires [PHP 7.1+](https://php.net/releases/)**

Via Laravel Zero Installer

```bash
composer global require laravel-zero/installer
```

```bash
laravel-zero new your-app-name
```

Or simply create a new Laravel Zero project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel-zero/laravel-zero your-app-name
```

Laravel Zero provides a default command placed in the `app/HelloCommand.php` file which will be executed by default. To execute it, run the following command in your app's directory:

```bash
php your-app-name
```

You can rename your app anytime by running the following command in your app directory:

```sh
php your-app-name app:rename new-name
```

## Usage

You may review the documentation of the Artisan Console component:

 - [Defining Input Expectations](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/artisan#defining-input-expectations).
 - [Command I/O](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/artisan#command-io).

## Components

Laravel Zero allows you to install a **Database** component out of the box to push your console app to the next level. As you might have already guessed it is Laravel's [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/eloquent) component that works with the same breeze in Laravel Zero environment too.

If you want to move files in your system, or to multiple providers like AwsS3 and Dropbox, you may consider the [Filesystem](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/filesystem) component.

To install the components run the following command in your Laravel Zero app directory:

```sh
php your-app-name component:install
```

Database usage:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

Schema::create('users', function ($table) {
    $table->increments('id');
    $table->string('email')->unique();
    $table->timestamps();
});

DB::table('users')->insert(
    ['email' => 'enunomaduro@gmail.com']
);

$users = DB::table('users')->get();

```

Filesystem usage:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\File;

File::put("file.txt", "Thank you for considering Laravel Zero.");

```

## Scheduler

Laravel Zero ships with the [Task Scheduling](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/scheduling) of Laravel, to use it you may need to add the following Cron entry to your server:

```
* * * * * php /path-to-your-project/your-app-name schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

You may define all of your scheduled tasks in the `schedule` method of the command:
```php
    public function schedule(Schedule $schedule): void
    {
        $schedule->command(static::class)->everyMinute();
    }
```

## Configuration

The configuration of your console application goes in `config\config.php`. In this file, you should define your application's list of commands and your Laravel Service Providers in this file.

```php

        'default-command' => App\Commands\HelloCommand::class,

        'commands' => [
            App\Commands\AddUserCommand::class,
        ],
```

<a name="build-a-standalone-application"></a>
## Building a standalone application

Your Laravel Zero project, by default, allows you to build a standalone PHAR archive to ease the deployment or the distribution of your project.

```sh
php your-app-name app:build <your-build-name>
```

The build will provide a single phar archive, ready to use, containing all the code of your project and its dependencies.

Note that the generated file will still need a PHP installation respecting your project's requirements (PHP version, extensions, etc.). You will then be able to execute it directly:

```sh
./builds/<your-build-name>
```

or on Windows:

```sh
C:\application\path> php builds\<your-build-name>
```
